# clas12Tags


This is a series of tags of the GEMC source code to match the various simulation/calibration/reconstruction software versions.

The tags also contain the geometry files and the gcard to run gemc.

Every tag is installed in /group/clas12/gemc

To use: 

source /group/clas12/gemc/environment.csh

If no tag is given, the env will load the latest tag automatically.
